# Missionary Smartphone
How to get your missionary a smartphone _without_ breaking the bank.

## Disclaimer
Believe it or not, this is not an official page owned or managed by _any_ church. 
I'm just a kid who served a mission one time (Kentucky, Louisville) and then served on the back end of Missionary Support. 
So, I'd like to think I've got some good tips! Just consider that every day that passes this information risks becoming _completely_ outdated.

## Premise
I'm a pretty smartphone-savvy guy, so getting a smartphone that met the strict requirements set forth for missionaries was actually not that challenging for me.
The _real_ problem was getting a smartphone cheap. 
I ended up spending $300 on my missionary smartphone, which I did in the tail-end of days when "expensive" smartphones were around $600 (those were the days).

The annoying part was that it turned out to be a terrible deal.

I purchased a pre-owned, Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930T, for the nerds out there) that was carrier-unlocked after market. 
But what was released as a state-of-the-art well-loved Samsung creation became a battery-starved, overheating, stuttery problem that came back to bite me during my mission.
The battery part was only partly due to it being pre-owned. Everything else was my lack of knowledge on the subject at the time.

So, as a returned missionary and smartphone enthusiast, I feel a great way I can continue to support the work is by offering my advice for future missionaries so they can avoid the issues I faced and have a smoother mission experience.

## Official Guidelines - Why they're somewhat unhelpful
The official requirements for a missionary smartphone _should_ be found [here](https://missionary.churchofjesuschrist.org/portal/acquire-a-missionary-smartphone) on the [Missionary Portal](missionary.churchofjesuschrist.org).[^1]
Now, last time I _saw_ the article, it was _kind of_ a monstrosity of hardware requirements and per-region exceptions/rules. 
It's rather confusing and overwhelming for most people, given the number of questions and concerns that were raised at missionary support while I served there.

So, allow me to give you the fast, simple version.

1. You need a Samsung phone. No iPhones, no non-Samsung Android phones.
2. You need a carrier-unlocked phone. This means the phone is not locked to using SIM cards from T-Mobile, Verizon, Mint Mobile, etc.
3. You need a _recent_ Samsung phone. (This is where the whole Knox version thing comes in)

Official guidelines say you should look at the phone you are interested in and compare it to [Samsung's Knox support table](https://www.samsungknox.com/en/knox-platform/supported-devices) to see if it's supported, 
as missionaries need the latest security features on their devices. 
Personally, I think you should do it the other way around. Look at the list of options and choose from there. We'll get to this later.

Okay, so you know what phone you need to get, now how about where to get it from?

This is the part of the process I find the most lacking in support. The reason for this can _probably_ be boiled down to liability. 

Officially, the Missionary Department offers devices for sale through Insight, a business-to-business IT company. 
This is because they can achieve a high-standard 'service level', which protects the church from liability, as Insight contractually accepts responsibility for problems with the purchased materials.

For corporations looking to arm their employees with minimal problems, this is ideal. For church members looking to buy a smartphone, well let's just say the premium price tag on such options is a bit of a turn off.

So, what else is there?

The Missionary Department cannot offer official stances on where to purchase an approved smartphone as there's really know way to fully trust any particular source. 
Serving on the support team we were told not even to recommend obvious options like Samsung official website or Amazon, which left our missionaries and their parents understandably frustrated.

## My Guidelines[^2]
Okay, so what do I think is the best option? Well, here are some tips:

[^2]: Take these with a grain of salt. This is not official, I'm unaffiliated with any involved organizations. Also, _fact check me_. Prices and availability _will_ change when I'm not looking.

### Don't Buy from Insight
Well, okay...there are some pros to using Insight. Mainly the warranty. 
If something happens with your phone, you're more likely to have a better experience with an Insight purchase. 
Additionally, a phone purchased through Insight's portal is guaranteed to meet all the requirements, which is a huge load of stress off at the expense of more money spent on the device. 
Personally, I find this point holds the most weight when it comes to finding a carrier-unlocked device outside of Samsung's website and Insight. It can be intimidating.

My problem with Insight options is that they are _extraordinarily_ overpriced.

As of writing, there are a total of six devices offered for United States missions, three for Canada, and five for the United Kingdom. 
For simplicity, I'll look mainly at the U.S. options, but I've found that my arguments seem to translate quite well to the other regions.
The first, and cheapest option is the Samsung A13 5G. This phone is offered on Insight, new, in-box, for $240. 

This _exact same device_ can be found in this _exact same condition_ for about $50 _less_. As stated above, you don't have Insight backing you, but that's a 20% price cut.

And if you _do_ want protections, you can check the box for 2-year protection that often goes ignored by most people.

### Don't Buy New If Cost is Prohibitive

Used markets can be downright scary, and full of scammers. Besides that, there are three main concerns when buying a used smartphone.
1. Used phone means used battery
2. Used phone means cosmetic wear
3. Used phone might have "quirks"

Let's address all of these issues.

#### Scary Used Markets
Look, I get it; I'll admit that I'm crazy for buying so much stuff, especially electronics, on the used market. 
What I've learned, however, is that this risk is something that drives customers away, so many used markets have checks in place to remove those concerns. 
Buyer protection on eBay, for example, isn't always guaranteed, but all you need to see is "Seller Accepts Returns" and "Seller Pays Shipping" to have most of your concerns put at ease.

YouTube is a good source for how to safely make purchases on a vast number of used markets. If you can't find something on YouTube about it...it may not be a safe option to begin with.

#### Used Battery - What does it even mean?
Here's a weird science fact [insert Bill Nye noises], a phone battery is just a bunch of flammable chemicals wrapped up in an air-tight package.

Okay why is that relevant? It turns out that the process of charging and discharging these sacks of chemicals will sometimes cause small failures in parts of the battery.
This process is very gradual, and there are checks in place on good batteries to make sure that nothing goes wrong (which is why generic/knock off replacement batteries are so problematic).
In the end, this leads to a battery's effective capacity shrinking over time as it is used.

So, how much worse does this make a used phone? Let's look at my current phone. I bought it just after I returned from my mission, and I've been using since for nearly three years.
I bought it used to save on money, and according to my battery health monitoring, it was capable of operating at about 85% of its 'expected' capacity. The phone had been used for under a year.
Now, the phone is operating at about 78%. So, the initial fall-off was 15% over one year, but then a mere 7% over the next three.

Outside of my own experience, I've found that the general consensus is that the first 10% of lost capacity occurs over about a month or two, depending on how heavy the phone use is.
What this boils down to is that, in terms of battery capacity, a new phone provides very little advantage over a phone used for about a year, and only slightly more over a phone used for two or more.

#### Cosmetic Wear

The nicer phones of today use a display type called OLED. 
OLED screens have something of a reputation for a thing called 'burn-in' where a permanent after-image is left on the device over long periods of use.
Burn-in, along with scratches and cracks on a used device, are generally reported in the listings for such items. 
Frankly, cosmetic damage on a missionary phone is probably not a big deal, and is probably worth dealing with to cut down on expenses.

#### Mysterious Quirks

I consider myself to be caught somewhere between an intermediate and expert[^3] when it comes to troubleshooting computers, phones, etc. 
Even with all of my knowledge and intuition, I will still come across problems that just _don't make sense_!
There's a reasonable amount of concern to be had when it comes to buying a used phone. Perhaps the previous owner got rid of it because of such a weird, unsolvable problem. 
If it isn't obvious to you, this is one reason why official recommendations are basically non-existent.

[^3]: Mind you, the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect is always sitting in the back of my mind to keep me guessing in this regard.

## State of the Smartphone Market
So, with the latest flagship phones costing well over $1000, and _good_ budget options rarely under $300, what options are available? 
Official guidelines say to reach out to your bishop if a phone can't be obtained for under $300, and with the market in its current state, 
that sounds like it could be the rule, rather than the exception.

The conclusion that I've come to, in the end of all of my analysis and attempts to find the best possible deals, is that the Used market is the best bet, even outside of obtaining a missionary device.
Prices for new phones are just ridiculous unless you are okay with sub-par, and if the motto of my current phone's manufacturer[^4] says anything about me, it's that I won't lie down and accept sub-par.

Now, I know what you're thinking: isn't a used phone sub-par? I'm here to argue that it really isn't that simple.

A Used phone is simply one that has been removed from the retail shelf and given to a customer. What happens to it afterwards can be anything from un-boxed and immediately returned, 
to kept in a protective case for a month, to accidently dropped off a hotel balcony.

The truth is, a Used phone in good initial condition is simply your phone after a week. The battery gets wear and tear, but that would happen to a new phone too. 
Scratches and dents can occur, but they'd happen to a new phone too. Really, buying a used phone just skips the honeymoon stage of having a shiny new phone to play with and pet like a kitten.

On a more personal, 'opinionated' note, I argue that e-waste is a serious environmental problem plaguing the world, and ignoring it or pretending it's no big deal is something I encourage everyone not to do.
One way to assist in reducing the magnitude of the issue is by purchasing one of the many perfectly-functional Used devices out there.

[^4]: I currently use a OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus's motto is "Never Settle".

## Okay, quit ranting and tell me where the cheap phones are!
Fine. In order of my personal preference[^5]:

### Swappa
I stumbled across Swappa when looking for the lowest possible price I could get for a OnePlus 7 Pro[^6] back in 2020.
While intrigued by the lower prices, I was naturally cautious to spend $500 on a website I'd only just found in a pile of search results.
In my research, however, I found nothing but stellar reviews of the service, and high accolades for Swappa's standards.

Swappa is meant to be a place where individuals can sell their phone[^7] with higher standards than on your average classifieds site. 
More often, you'll see phones for sale by various small to medium-sized businesses from all over the country that resell and refurbish phones.

Listings on Swappa have strict requirements in order to remain up visible, and Swappa has [high standards for device condition](https://swappa.com/faq/general/condition-requirements) 
that make purchasing phones even down to 'Good' condition a surprisingly viable option. 
The only damage allowed on Swappa listings can be minor cosmetic things, like scratches or light burn-in. Cracked glass is an automatic no-go.

More importantly for mission-related purchases, there is an entire category devoted to each brand of phone, and additional categorization for unlocked devices. 
As such, one can...oh, I don't know...visit the [Unlocked Phone catalog filtered by Samsung Phones](https://swappa.com/catalog/carrier/unlocked?brand=samsung&type=phone) 
and find a list of potential mission phones ranging from $100 (or $120 in good condition) to as "high" as $400 for the newer models.

It should be obvious, but you should still check any phone model you are interested in buying to make absolutely sure that it meets official requirements for a missionary smartphone.
If you miss a tiny detail, I get the feeling, but it's still on you.

Since I bought my phone on Swappa, I've convinced my younger siblings to come here for their smartphone needs, and we've all had great experiences with them. 
Even now, my sister is on her own mission, using a Swappa-purchased device with no difficulties whatsoever...at least none that she's told me.

### OfferUp & Mercari
These two services are pretty impressive. They essentially act as a typical classifieds site, but with built-in buyer protection to _reduce_ the risk of getting scammed.
Personally, I have yet to buy a smartphone from these services, but I've gotten several other electronics and computer components with good experiences both in the resulting items, 
and in the return process for when the item doesn't turn out to be the best purchase in the end.

You'll want to be extra careful with buying devices here, as guaranteeing it's carrier-unlocked must be done _after_ it arrives in the mail by testing on your end.
Prices can be lower on these sites than on Swappa, but the added complications make me hesitant to recommend it for inexperienced buyers.

### Back Market
Back Market is actually a fascinating site. I put it low in my list simply because I have yet to use it myself. I have heard good things about it from others, however.
Swappa's always beaten them on price when I'm shopping to actually buy.
What makes Back Market interesting is that they handle things much more like a standard retail site, but they sell mostly used and refurbished products.
I would encourage you to research this site on your own, much like what I did when I discovered Swappa, but my outlook on it is overall quite positive.

### Craigslist, KSL, etc...sort of
If you've ever trodden the path of classified ads, you know that they're a mixed bag. 
You can score an incredible deal using services like this (I have), but you can also find nothing but scammers and high-and-mighty sellers of overpriced mediocrity (I have). 
In a short phrase: Tread Lightly.

[^5]: For the U.S. market, at least. I honestly have no idea about anywhere else. As much as I'd love to be less-sheltered, I have yet to step foot off soil that isn't in United States jurisdiction.
[^6]: I'd fixated on it being my phone of choice, but at the time it was so expensive! I did not want to pay more than $600 for a brainy slab of glass.
[^7]: Swappa does allow users to sell more than just phones, but it's mostly phones that you'll find there.

## Samsung Phones - Which ones are good?
Subject to rapid, unpredictable change.

### Nomenclature
When it comes to Samsung's phones that are available in the U.S. there are essentially four categories you should know about, and only three you should consider buying.

#### The S-series: Flagships
Every year, phone manufacturers release a new flagship phone, with as many new bells and whistles as they can cram in so that it's clear that they're better than the competition. 
These phones run faster than their predecessors and have better cameras. They support insane fast-charging rates, and get software updates for longer than budget models.
Unfortunately, I've seen repeated instances where the S-series phones struggle with overheating, poor battery life, and stuttering performance after a few years on the market. 
Some say that it's a conspiracy to mar the old phones to encourage upgrades, and since Apple does this unabashedly, there's really no reason to think Samsung doesn't do it as well.

Every year, the model number increments by one. In 2020 they skipped the S11-S19 names to they could synchronize their phone name with the current year. So, in 2020, they released the S20, in 2021 the S21, and so on.

Each release comes with different variants. Sometimes a physically larger "Plus" model, sometimes a higher-powered "Ultra" model. 
In the last three years they've taken a liking to releasing an "FE" phone (short for 'Fan Edition') that changes a few things from the base model and costs less.

#### The Note-series
These release along with the S-series, with the same number. They are generally more powerful and larger than their brother, and come with a garaged stylus.

As of 2022, the Note series has been discontinued, and the features of the Note series have been moved to the "Ultra" flavor of the S-series phones.

#### The J-series: Budget Bumbs
J-series phones were extremely low-specced phones often sold to Carriers as a cheap option for their customers who couldn't afford monthly payments for S-series phones.
They were so cheap, in fact, that many carriers offered them as a promotional "Free Phone" for anyone starting a subscription to their plan.

J-series phones you may still occasionally find in the wild are labeled JX, where "X" is a number that can roughly correlate to how good the phone was.

The J-series phones eventually developed a reputation for being extremely slow, and the entire line was discontinued in 2020. They no longer meet mission phone standards.

#### The A-series: Budget 2, Electric Boogaloo
Samsung A-series phones vary widely in their power and capabilities. 
Currently, A-series phones are labeled AXY, where "X" roughly indicates the power level or tier of phone, and "Y" is the release generation.

The first few years of A-series phones only had one number in the name. These devices should be avoided, as they're older and don't meet mission phone standards.

Presently, one of the most effective ways one can divide the good phones from the bad in the budget series is whether or not they support 5G. 
In fact, there are even some A-series phones that have 5G and non-5G variants, where the 5G-supporting version is significantly better-performing than its counterpart[^8]

[^8]: A prime example of this situation is the A13, which feels sluggish right out of the box, and the A13 5G, which uses one of the top 50 fasted phone processors, has a 
smooth, high-refresh-rate screen, double the default storage, and an additional sensor for its camera array!

### Fast or Slow?
So, where's the line between fast and slow? Well, it changes every year (surprise, surprise.) but since I've been watching this market evolve for a while now, I'll share my opinions.

#### S-series and Note-series:
I've met people who owned S-series phones all the way back to the S6, and I've noticed a surprisingly consistent pattern that S-series owners are generally happy with their device until about three years after its release date.
That's about when the problems that have been developing over that entire time seem to go from tolerable to frustrating.

My conclusion for the S-series is to avoid anything older than a year or two, as you want to get some life out of it before the problems surface, especially if you plan on it lasting through an entire mission. 
The Note series is a much rarer encounter in the wild, so I don't have as much on it, but since it's basically just an S-series with a pen and bigger battery, I would lean towards the same conclusion. 
Mind you, with a bigger battery, you're likely to be better off buying a 2-year-old Note-series or Ultra than a 2-year-old standard S-series.

#### A-series:
When the A-series phones were first gaining traction, with the A10 and A20 being the ultra-low budget options, I felt like I could recommend the A20 for someone really needing the cheapest option.
Since then, the software has gotten a fair bit harder to run smoothly, and I honestly can't say I recommend anything lower than an A50 or A31, and even then, the A31 feels like pushing the envelope.

What messes up my whole intuition is the 5G variants. 5G _provides_ a lot of internet bandwidth, which means needing a stronger processor to handle it. 
As such, in the current market, any A-series phone with 5G support is generally a pretty safe bet, although in the interest of giving missionaries decent cameras, 
I would still recommend an A30-series or better.

## Model Recommendations
Subject to even more rapid, unpredictable change.

No seriously. Because it's the Used market, you can literally have old, powerful phones selling for less than bottom-tier options because the slower phone is newer[^9].

[^9]: A example of this weirdness on the market right now is the price of a used S21 FE compared to the A53 5G. 
The S21 is significantly better in all respects, but is available for the same price as the just-as-recent A53 5G. 
The likely cause of this is simply that the S-series phones tend to lose their value faster due to their reputation for getting worse after that three-year mark.

### Samsung Galaxy A71 5G
This device feels like a unicorn. It has the effective horsepower and statistics of a Galaxy S10 5G, but slimmed down. All of the power-hungry bells and whistles are gone.
The camera is improved. The software updated. The battery life improved. Best of all for a technician like myself, replacement parts (mainly batteries and screens) are cheap and easy to install, 
as expensive glass backing has been replaced with cheaper, more durable plastic.

Protect this phone with a case and screen protector, and it's an incredible option for the mission and beyond. 
I recommended this phone to my sister when she got her call, and she has found it to be excellent, especially compared to other mission phones she's encountered.
I also discovered that one of my cousins got this phone when she returned from her mission, and she's had no issues with it at all for the last several years.

Now, what about the price? There's no way a phone can be this good without costing something.
Well, when my sister bought hers, she paid $200. Now I can find it as low as $150.

### Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G
If price is still a concern, but you want a camera to rival your iPhone, the A71 5G has met its match, as its base camera is good, but lacks other modules to back it up.
In lieu of that, the S21 FE offers a significant upgrade in...well all departments, really.

The camera array will go toe-to-toe with an iPhone in terms of raw hardware, and the processor is a raging beast compared to the A71 5G.
The downside to that being that a missionary generally needs better battery life more than killer performance.

The S21 FE 5G is going for around $250. It's a two-year-old flagship phone for the same price as a new A13 on Insight. I'll let you decide which one is the better buy.

### Samsung Galaxy S22
Yes. 2022's flagship. Feels like it came out yesterday to me. This thing will run in circles around the iPhone 14's camera.

On Swappa? Less than $400. If you really want the fastest thing on the market, you do _not_ need to spend as four figures.

## Conclusion
I talk too much.
### No really, tldr[^10]
Check the missionary smartphone requirements in case they've changed since I last looked (and/or updated this), then get a Samsung Galaxy A71 5G from Swappa if it still meets the standards.
