# 80+ Certification

When it comes to a PC power supply, there are really only three main things you can easily look for: total wattage, available connectors, and the 80+ Certification. 
The first two are rather straightforward. The latter is often misunderstood and misrepresented.

To quickly summarize, the 80+ Certification is a measure of a power supply's efficiency in converting AC power from the wall into DC power the computer needs.

You may find people under the impression that it:

* Denotes a power supply's longevity
* Denotes a power supply's heat generation
* Indicates a 'specified' vs 'actual' power output.

None of these are considered, although aspects that the 80+ standard uses in its testing _may_ also affect these metrics. 
Correlations, if any, should be considered widely variable between different power supply models.
