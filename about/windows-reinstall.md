# Windows Reinstalls
A fresh start is nice, but it usually means a _lot_ of work to do.

## Operating System Recovery
We've all seen it happen. You've got a computer, and stuff you want to do on it. But something just _isn't right_! What can you do?

Lots of things can break the software running on your PC, and the fortunte thing about a software problem is that a reinstall can fix it.
The problem with a reinstall of your entire OS is that your data is ususally whiped out in the process. 
You have to back up and restore all of your documents, pictures, and music. Then re-install your apps, change all of your settings, and log into your services.
It can take hours, if not days. For many, it's just not worth it, even if their might be a virus hanging around doing who knows what.

I specialize in reinstalling Windows on a PC and using complex, dynamic backup techniques that allow for the restoration of your apps, data, and settings.
It's not a perfect process, but I've had to reinstall Windows on my own stuff more than I care to admit, and my techniques have saved me hours of tedious work.

Give me a laptop and a day, and I'll have your laptop running good as new without losing any of your data.

## PC Migration
A new PC is an exciting time, but it can be a pain as well. 
Suddenly you have stuff in two different places, and it can be hard to keep track of where everything is and what you moved over.

You're not a lone. I've done this a lot myself, and I know how to do it fast to keep downtime to a minimum.
