# Android Mods
Look, if I'm gonna call it a smartphone, I at least want it to behave how I want, instead of how a company *thinks* I want.

## Root
> Open the floodgates

In the Apple world, we hear about 'jailbreaking' an iPhone to make special customizations or install custom apps that Apple doesn't approve of. 
For Android, however there's something even better. Root permissions allow for an app to bypass any security restrictions put in place.
This can be bad, of course. You don't want a virus with root permissions on your phone.
But what if you want your phone to back up sensitive data, or dynamically apply dark mode to apps that don't have one?
What if you want to emulate a Joycon with your phone?
If you can grant root permissions on your device, then you can do it. Be careful, be smart, and the possibilities are nearly endless.

## De-Google
> Stalking is illegal...unless you're a _corporate_ entity?

Raise your hand if you like how Google, Apple, and Facebook sell all the data about you that they can get their hands on!

Yeah, didn't think so. With the right skills, you can severely limit the vision that Google has on your activity. 
With the right type of phone, you can even remove all Google services *entirely*!

Even if you don't care too much about corporate stalking, a good De-Googling has worked wonders for my phone's battery life!

Bring me your phone and your interests and I can offer you options. 
If you're phone can't do what you want, I can show you how to get a cheap, yet powerful phone that can.

## Custom ROMs
> If they won't update their phone, we will!

ROM is short for Read-Only Memory. A Custom ROM on Android is a customized version of the storage you can't access:
the design, features, and security of the phone. 
Custom ROMs are built by memebers of the modding community, so devices can get security patches and more years after the manufacturer stops making updates.

Custom ROMs are extremely powerful, and while not *every* phone has custom ROMs available, the ones that do have a lot of potential.

I personally use [LineageOS](lineageos.org), one of the most popular custom ROMs on the internet. 
I can run it with Google's taps, or without, and it comes with its own set of custom security features as well.

## Custom Recovery
> If it ain't broke, don't assume it will stay that way.

Recovery mode is a pretty self-explanatory part of Android. It's there so you can do more technical work to fix a broken Android setup.

with a custom recovery, however, you have even more options at your disposal.

The TeamWin Recovery Project, or TWRP, is a custom recovery that allows for the backup and restore of your entire system, so you can try out a custom ROM without losing anything of value.
