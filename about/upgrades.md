# OS Upgrades
Companies will drop support for their products after a while. We don't have to let that stop us.

## Windows 11
> It's just Windows 10 with a fresh coat of paint.

Windows 11 comes with a few nice features. Lots of new looks, some new features, and better support for new hardware.
But Microsoft has been rather stingy, and only allows Windows 10 PCs to upgrade if they run hardware at most about four years old.

Or, at least that's what they *want* the story to be.

With the right skills and tools, you can upgrade just about any PC to Windows 11 without losing any significant functionality. 
With that upgrade comes those new features, increased security, and an OS with a lifespan beyond October of 2025.

## MacOS Ventura
> Apple says you can't, but they just haven't tried hard enough.

Apple loves to drop support for their Macbooks, iMacs, etc. after a few years. 
If you run older hardware, they just want you to upgrade, after all, it's probably *super* slow now.

Believe it or not, they're usually wrong. I'm typing this on a 2014 Macbook Air that 'doesn't support' MacOS Monterey or Ventura. 

But I run Ventura, and you can too.

## Android
> If the company stops, the community starts.

The Custom ROM scene on Android is an impressive community. 
While most people focus on adding bonus or custom features to devices that didn't have them before, 
a convenient benefit of the Custom ROMs is that they can keep you on the latest version of Android well past when the corporations stop caring.

My current phone of choice is only supported to Android 12, but thanks to community updates, I can safely run Android 13, and eventually 14 when it's released.
