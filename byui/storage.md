These are cheap, but will get the job done. If price is less of a problem, SanDisk makes what are generally accepted to be the best.

* [JOIOT](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FXWSYWB?th=1) ($70 for 1TB)
* [Netac](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088BTHTTX?th=1) ($80 for 1TB)
* [Crucial](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9WKGXHD?th=1) ($95 for 1TB)

Prices can go down as far as about $25 for only 250GB, which is not a lot but that's how big mine is XD
