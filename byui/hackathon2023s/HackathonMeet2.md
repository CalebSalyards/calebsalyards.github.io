### Notes from previous Hackathon(s)
* Two companies gave meals
* Melaleuca got us shirts
* Prizes were sponsored by the Department (laptops, arduino boards, monitors, mice, etc.)
    * That was not ideal for the school's bean counters (tax stuff and all)
    * We'd prefer to have the companies sponsor the prizes
* Last Hackaton was run by ACM-W, went slightly over their $2,000 budget.
